#R to LaTeX
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to test how to write strings in R-language. R-files contain functions that calculate basic statistic formulas without using any pre-written functions. Additionally the functions for strings that contain formulas, detailed calculations and in numeric form the results. The strings are formed in LaTeX-syntax so that they can be easily used in LaTeX.

## Issues
This is still a work in progress and issues remain. 

**Known issues**
 - code needs to be refactored
 - haven't figured out how to write backslash and certain characters, i.e. '\c' in string form. Currently prints out '\\c' instead of '\c'
